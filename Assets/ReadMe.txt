Folder-Structure:

	_ressources -> Notes / Scribbles / Everything for project, but not directly in the game
	Assets      -> Every sprite / material / sounds
	Prefabs     -> All Prefabs build for Designers
	Scripts     -> All Programming stuff
	Levels      -> Each scene represents a level, they go here
	Items       -> All Items go there
	Menu        -> All UI Stuff is happening here

Workflow:
	Copy the template scene -> Build new level
	Programmers / Designers -> Link them to each other


Important Reminders:
	Backup as often as you can! (Also local!)
